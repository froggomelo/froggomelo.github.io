                <p>I am a proud Jo'burger and I love cats. And I love technology! And I especially love what technology can do for human and cat problems :D I am currently attending the University of the Witwatersrand. I am in my third year of studying for a BSc in Computer Science and have found it to be fulfilling and rewarding.</p>

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>We have created a workflow for RNA m5C Modification Site Detection. The solution employs Snakefiles, Conda, and scripting to automate the workflow for detecting the m5C modification. The workflow is modularised by breaking the main Snakefile into multiple components. </p>
